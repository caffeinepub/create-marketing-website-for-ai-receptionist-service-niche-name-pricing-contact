  "summary": "REQ-2 appears implemented via a hostname state and (per summary) a footer indicator. REQ-1 (republishing / ensuring callcraftai.caffeine.xyz serves the SPA) cannot be confirmed from code diffs alone; changes add redirect/canonical hints but do not prove deployment/republish occurred. Several additional unrequested marketing/SEO/styling changes were introduced.",

      "reason": "The diff shows client-side redirect logic and a canonical link, but there is no evidence in the provided file changes that the app was actually republished or that the Caffeine hosting configuration now serves the SPA at callcraftai.caffeine.xyz (acceptance criteria are deployment/hosting outcomes, not just code changes).",
